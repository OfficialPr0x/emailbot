## ❓ FAQ

### "How do I change the countdown date?"
**File**: `website/src/components/CountdownTimer.jsx`  
**Line 5**: `new Date('2025-11-15T12:00:00-05:00')`  
Change to your launch date.

### "How do I update keys remaining?"
Right now it's hardcoded to 653. To make it dynamic:
1. Set up backend API (see `PRESALE_BACKEND_SETUP.md`)
2. API should return `{ remaining: X }`
3. Update happens automatically via `stripe.js` service

### "Payment modal opens but Stripe fails"
You need to configure:
1. `.env` file with `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
2. Backend endpoint at `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`
3. Stripe product created in dashboard

### "Exit modal won't show"
It only triggers:
- When mouse leaves from **top** of viewport
- **Once per session** (uses sessionStorage)
- Must be on **homepage** (not other routes)

### "Mobile looks broken"
All components are responsive. If something looks off:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Tailwind CSS is loading
3. Test on real device (not just resize)
